      <h2>MISSION</h2>

      <p>To create a space for Bgirls to learn, session, cypher and build community elevating women in the Seattle Hip Hop breakin scene.</p>

      <h2>VISION</h2>

      <p>Empower and uplift women in the Hip Hop breakin scene for a healthier, safe and balanced environment that will benefit all communities.</p>

      <h2>HISTORY</h2>

      <p>Since 2001 three Bgirls, Naj, Bean and Lee dived into the breakin' culture that quickly became a huge part of their expression, growth and purpose. Over the years there was a growing desire to create more space for other Bgirls that was not intimidating and celebrated women. Their strong connection as women was a main factor in encouraging each other to continue their passion in the breakin' scene. They asked themselves, "would more Bgirls start and stick around if we did more for them? Yes!"</p>

      <p>CYPHER Queenz began in 2019 after many years of seeing a need for more community for Bgirls. We give props to all the Bgirls who have been holding it down for a long time, but have observed many women briefly coming into the scene and then quickly leaving because of lack of support. There is an explosion of talented Bgirls all over the world now and there is so much more to come. In Seattle, we want to provide that space for them.</p>
